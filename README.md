# CodeWarsChallenges
A collection of the challenges I have completed on codewars.com

The website www.codewars.com features a collection of different coding challenges 
Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.

Codewars has a great kata repository, and the level of difficulty is marked by kyu/dan degrees. This ranking type is based on some popular martial arts degree type style. 8 kyu is the “lowest” rank available, while 1 kyu is the highest.
